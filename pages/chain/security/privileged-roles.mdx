# Privileged Roles in OP Mainnet

OP Mainnet is on a [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/our-pragmatic-path-to-decentralization-cb5805ca43c1).
In its current state, the network still includes some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability to carry out specific actions.
Read this page to understand these roles, why they exist, and what risks they pose.

## L1 Proxy Admin

The L1 Proxy Admin is an address that can be used to upgrade most OP Mainnet system contracts.

### Risks

*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could upgrade contracts to malicious versions.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could remove or lock ETH or tokens in the Standard Bridge.
*   Compromised L1 Proxy Admin could fail to mitigate a risk as described on this page.

### Mitigations

*   L1 Proxy Admin is a 5-of-7 [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BA6e03D8B90dE867373Db8cF1A58d2F7F006b3A#readProxyContract).
*   L1 Proxy Admin may eventually be operated by a [Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885).
